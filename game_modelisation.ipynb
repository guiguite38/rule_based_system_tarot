    "## Foreword\n",
    "The idea here is to implement an ensemble of rules and conventions in French Tarot* so that the players make oriented decisions, and increase their chances of victory.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main features of this 'Rule based system' can be found :\n",
    "- in Player class :\n",
    "    - open() -> \"What should I do if I must play the first card of the trick ?\"\n",
    "    - answer() -> \"What should I respond if cards have already been played ?\"\n",
    "- in Game class :\n",
    "    - estimate_win_factor() -> \"How great are my chances of victory ?\"\n",
    "    - incorporate_dog() -> \"If I am Taker and may realize an 'ecart', what cards should be put aside first ?\"\n",
    "- in Tricks class :\n",
    "    - compute_cut_risk() -> \"Is playing this card safe ?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "*French Tarot rules are available here : https://www.pagat.com/tarot/frtarot.html\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many cases and exceptions in every tarot game, my tests cover the great majority of them but some may have been left aside, so don't worry too much if you encounter a bug."
